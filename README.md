Our data is based on a mockup, so you need to use this inputs to test the application

- **Email:** ps@fiap.com.br
- **Password:** 10
- **Birthdate:** any date greater than 18 year

These datas will create a notification with a message saying your login was validated

If you enter something unexpected you'll be notificated with a message saying your login wasn't validated
